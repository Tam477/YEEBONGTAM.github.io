## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Deep Midnight Blue (#081221), providing a foundational 'Cinematic Dark Mode' theme that evokes depth and professionalism.
- Primary accent color: Vibrant Orange (#FF5733), utilized for high-visibility elements such as buttons, hover states, and key highlights to inject energy and draw user attention.
- Secondary accent color: Cyan Blue (#00A8E8), employed for technical indicators like borders, technology stack labels, and progress bars, providing a cool, analytical contrast to the vibrant orange.
- Headlines and body text: 'Inter', a modern grotesque-style sans-serif font. Its clean, objective aesthetic aligns with the technical and innovative theme of the portfolio.
- Social media icons (LinkedIn, Email, Phone) rendered in a monochrome style and centrally aligned, contributing to a clean and sophisticated visual design.
- The site implements a single-page parallax structure with a distinct left-side identity block and a right-side value proposition in the hero, transitioning into structured, content-rich sections below.
- Sections beneath the hero are designed with a cinematic dark aesthetic, incorporating 'glassmorphism' cards for projects and a visually engaging vertical timeline for professional experience, ensuring full mobile responsiveness.
- A subtle 'Scale & Fade' parallax effect enhances the hero background image on scroll, alongside section-level 'fade in and slide up' scroll reveal animations for smooth content loading.
- Interactive elements, such as project cards, feature a lifting and cyan-glowing effect on hover. A simple loading bar will appear before the hero section content fully displays.
